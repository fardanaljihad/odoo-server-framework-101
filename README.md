## Getting started with Odoo

For a standard installation please follow the [Setup instructions](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/administration/install/install.html)
from the documentation.

To learn the software, we recommend the [Odoo eLearning](https://www.odoo.com/slides),
or [Scale-up, the business game](https://www.odoo.com/page/scale-up-business-game).
Developers can start with [the developer tutorials](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/howtos.html).

## Prerequisites

Before you start installing Odoo 18, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.12.** â€“ Required for running Odoo.
- **PostgreSQL 12+** â€“ Database server for storing Odoo data.
- **Git** â€“ To clone the Odoo source code repository.
- **pip** â€“ Python package manager to install dependencies.
- **Homebrew** (optional) â€“ Useful for installing Python, PostgreSQL, and other dependencies easily on Mac.


## How to Source Install Odoo on Mac

Follow these steps to set up Odoo from source:

### 1. Clone the Odoo repository
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch 18.0 https://github.com/odoo/odoo --single-branch odoo
cd odoo
```

### 2. Create the `odoo.conf` File
Inside the odoo.conf file, paste the following content:
```bash
[options]

; Is This The Password That Allows Database Operations:
admin_passwd = admin

db_host = localhost
db_port = 5432
db_user = odoo
db_password = odoo

addons_path = /home/user/odoo/addons  # Change this to your actual addons path
xmlrpc_port = 8017
```

### 3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install required Python packages
```bash
pip3 install setuptools wheel
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Running Odoo
```bash
python3 odoo-bin --addons-path=addons -d [db_name]
```
After the server has started (the INFO log odoo.modules.loading: Modules loaded. is printed), open http://localhost:8069 in a web browser and log into the Odoo database with the base administrator account: use `admin` as the email and, again, `admin` as the password.
